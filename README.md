# SpaceEngineersHydrogenGenerator
Creating a hydrogen generator for Space Engineers

# Creating the functionality

1. Duplicating the OxygenFarm
    - reusing its model, texture, code

2. Reusing the OxygenFarm to produce Hydrogen
    - change the generated gas

3. Implementing dependencies on when and how Hydrogen is generated
    - implement logics to check that Hydrogen is only produced on planets with atmosphere and in sunlight or under use of much energy

# Creating own model, texture...

1. Creating own 3D model

2. Add basic textures

3. apply other SE specific layers (orientation, connection ports, ...)

4. Construction models

5. LOD models

# Apply other SE specific functionalities

1. Include HydrogenGenerator into Process Tree
